# Algorithms and data structures

Spring semester 2021, I followed the course "Algorithms and data structures" at DTU. 

The course included algorithmic concepts, data structures, and graph algorithms. The course focused on describing algorithms, its complexity and how to solve problems using algorithms. However, I felt benefited by implementing the algorithms in C++, which is what this repository consists of.

This repository works as my own summary of the course, and explanation of the topics can therefore be found in the README-files. In addition, some of the codes includes thorough comments describing the algorithms.
