# Weighted graph
Similar implementation as a regular graph, but each edge e has a weight w(e).

A weighted graph can be represented by an adjacency list, where both neighbour and weight is stored. In this implementation, this will be used by an vector of pairs of integers. An example of a weighted graph with associated adjacency list is given below.
